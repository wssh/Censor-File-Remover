# Censor-File-Remover

Simple script written in Python to practice and play around with tkinter.
Used to remove the censor file which restricts swear words found in Phantasy Star Online 2(even though it's a Japanese online game, a lot of English words are censored. It is like they were anticipating foreign players despite stating that foreigners are banned on their ToS)

Free to use.
